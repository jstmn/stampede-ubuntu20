Paths are from the CppFlow github repo: https://github.com/jstmn/cppflow, and orginally from the 'TORM' github repo: https://github.com/cheulkang/TORM/tree/main/src/data/scene

These path files are saved with the format `time,x,y,z,qw,qx,wy,wz`. Each path has a total time of 20seconds to complete, this value is arbitrary however
